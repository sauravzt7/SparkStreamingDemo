I added the missing three and reworked many of the others to 1) maintain balance between light and heavy armor types, 2) make sure the light/heavy status reflects the nature of the enchantment, 3) make dragon priest masks worth having compared to low- or mid-tier armor types, and 3) feature the maximum variety of material types, all while 4) ensuring the material type matches the mask's appearance (with the exception of Miraak, which I left unchanged). Here's the specifics:\r\n\r\nAdded the three other Dragon Priest Masks from Dragonborn:\r\nAhzidal - ScaledHeavy\r\nDukaan - HNordicHigh\r\nZahkriisos - EbonyLight\r\n\r\nChanged some of the materials on the existing Dragon Priest mask entries:\r\nOtar - GoldHeavy (from Glass) - better suited to heavy armor, and doesn't look like glass; glass is blue. The glass mask should probably be:\r\nMorokei - Glass (from Elven) - Krosis is already elven, so this prevents repeats (and it looks great with glass armor).\r\nVokun - LNordicHigh (from Steel Plate) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\nRahgot - OrkishLight (from Orkish) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\n\r\nKicked the stats for some of the other masks up to \"_High\" - nothing's more depressing than a crappy Dragon Priest mask. Specifically:\r\nKonahrik - DwarvenHigh (from Dwarven)\r\nHevnoraak - IronHigh (from Iron)\r\nVolsung - ScaledHigh (from Scaled) - it has a crappy enchantment, so it needs the armor rating boost.\r\nKrosis - ElvenHigh (from Elven)\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with 7 heavy and 6 light masks - Seems balanced.\r\n\r\nTL;DR I expanded and reworked Dragon Priest masks.","sha":"d2e68f31d0a91884c65ec454d5e7c56e1c66c3b3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/commits/d2e68f31d0a91884c65ec454d5e7c56e1c66c3b3"}],"distinct_size":1,"head":"d2e68f31d0a91884c65ec454d5e7c56e1c66c3b3","push_id":536864157,"ref":"refs/heads/patch-1","size":1},"public":true,"repo":{"id":28687886,"name":"Derathir/PCaPP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP"},"type":"PushEvent","copyID":10364471,"copyType":"PushEvent","count":1,"activityLevel":"InActive"}

noticed that of the four Dragon Priest masks added by Dragonborn, only Miraak was covered by the XML. I added the missing three and reworked many of the others to 1) maintain balance between light and heavy armor types, 2) make sure the light/heavy status reflects the nature of the enchantment, 3) make dragon priest masks worth having compared to low- or mid-tier armor types, and 3) feature the maximum variety of material types, all while 4) ensuring the material type matches the mask's appearance (with the exception of Miraak, which I left unchanged). Here's the specifics:\r\n\r\nAdded the three other Dragon Priest Masks from Dragonborn:\r\nAhzidal - ScaledHeavy\r\nDukaan - HNordicHigh\r\nZahkriisos - EbonyLight\r\n\r\nChanged some of the materials on the existing Dragon Priest mask entries:\r\nOtar - GoldHeavy (from Glass) - better suited to heavy armor, and doesn't look like glass; glass is blue. The glass mask should probably be:\r\nMorokei - Glass (from Elven) - Krosis is already elven, so this prevents repeats (and it looks great with glass armor).\r\nVokun - LNordicHigh (from Steel Plate) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\nRahgot - OrkishLight (from Orkish) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\n\r\nKicked the stats for some of the other masks up to \"_High\" - nothing's more depressing than a crappy Dragon Priest mask. Specifically:\r\nKonahrik - DwarvenHigh (from Dwarven)\r\nHevnoraak - IronHigh (from Iron)\r\nVolsung - ScaledHigh (from Scaled) - it has a crappy enchantment, so it needs the armor rating boost.\r\nKrosis - ElvenHigh (from Elven)\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with 7 heavy and 6 light masks - Seems balanced.\r\n\r\nTL;DR I expanded and reworked Dragon Priest masks.","changed_files":1,"comments":0,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/issues/1/comments","commits":1,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/pulls/1/commits","created_at":"2015-01-01T15:01:06Z","deletions":16,"diff_url":"https://github.com/Raulfin/PCaPP/pull/1.diff","head":{"label":"Derathir:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","repo":{"archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/{archive_format}{/ref}","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/branches{/branch}","clone_url":"https://github.com/Derathir/PCaPP.git","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/contributors","created_at":"2015-01-01T14:16:43Z","default_branch":"master","description":"Repository

If the file is copied over, the application will launch as expected.\r\n\r\nThis pull request makes a simple change in the Gruntfile so that the icudtl.dat is copied over every time that 'grunt

I added the missing three and reworked many of the others to 1) maintain balance between light and heavy armor types, 2) make sure the light/heavy status reflects the nature of the enchantment, 3) make dragon priest masks worth having compared to low- or mid-tier armor types, and 3) feature the maximum variety of material types, all while 4) ensuring the material type matches the mask's appearance (with the exception of Miraak, which I left unchanged). Here's the specifics:\r\n\r\nAdded the three other Dragon Priest Masks from Dragonborn:\r\nAhzidal - ScaledHeavy\r\nDukaan - HNordicHigh\r\nZahkriisos - EbonyLight\r\n\r\nChanged some of the materials on the existing Dragon Priest mask entries:\r\nOtar - GoldHeavy (from Glass) - better suited to heavy armor, and doesn't look like glass; glass is blue. The glass mask should probably be:\r\nMorokei - Glass (from Elven) - Krosis is already elven, so this prevents repeats (and it looks great with glass armor).\r\nVokun - LNordicHigh (from Steel Plate) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\nRahgot - OrkishLight (from Orkish) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\n\r\nKicked the stats for some of the other masks up to \"_High\" - nothing's more depressing than a crappy Dragon Priest mask. Specifically:\r\nKonahrik - DwarvenHigh (from Dwarven)\r\nHevnoraak - IronHigh (from Iron)\r\nVolsung - ScaledHigh (from Scaled) - it has a crappy enchantment, so it needs the armor rating boost.\r\nKrosis - ElvenHigh (from Elven)\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with 7 heavy and 6 light masks - Seems balanced.\r\n\r\nTL;DR I expanded and reworked Dragon Priest masks.","closed_at":"2015-01-01T15:02:55Z","comments":1,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/issues/1/comments","created_at":"2015-01-01T15:01:06Z","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/issues/1/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Raulfin/PCaPP/pull/1","id":53221356,"labels":[],"labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/issues/1/labels{/name}","locked":false,"number":1,"pull_request":{"diff_url":"https://github.com/Raulfin/PCaPP/pull/1.diff","html_url":"https://github.com/Raulfin/PCaPP/pull/1","patch_url":"https://github.com/Raulfin/PCaPP/pull/1.patch","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/pulls/1"},"state":"closed","title":"Armor.xml","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:02:55Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/issues/1","user":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10364471?v=3","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/Derathir","id":10364471,"login":"Derathir","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir"}}},"public":true,"repo":{"id":28668553,"name":"Raulfin/PCaPP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP"},"type":"IssueCommentEvent","copyID":10364471,"copyType":"PushEvent","count":1,"activityLevel":"InActive"}

noticed that of the four Dragon Priest masks added by Dragonborn, only Miraak was covered by the XML. I added the missing three and reworked many of the others to 1) maintain balance between light and heavy armor types, 2) make sure the light/heavy status reflects the nature of the enchantment, 3) make dragon priest masks worth having compared to low- or mid-tier armor types, and 3) feature the maximum variety of material types, all while 4) ensuring the material type matches the mask's appearance (with the exception of Miraak, which I left unchanged).

noticed that of the four Dragon Priest masks added by Dragonborn, only Miraak was covered by the XML. I added the missing three and reworked many of the others to 1) maintain balance between light and heavy armor types, 2) make sure the light/heavy status reflects the nature of the enchantment, 3) make dragon priest masks worth having compared to low- or mid-tier armor types, and 3) feature the maximum variety of material types, all while 4) ensuring the material type matches the mask's appearance (with the exception of Miraak, which I left unchanged). Here's the specifics:\r\n\r\nAdded the three other Dragon Priest Masks from Dragonborn:\r\nAhzidal - ScaledHeavy\r\nDukaan - HNordicHigh\r\nZahkriisos - EbonyLight\r\n\r\nChanged some of the materials on the existing Dragon Priest mask entries:\r\nOtar - GoldHeavy (from Glass) - better suited to heavy armor, and doesn't look like glass; glass is blue. The glass mask should probably be:\r\nMorokei - Glass (from Elven) - Krosis is already elven, so this prevents repeats (and it looks great with glass armor).\r\nVokun - LNordicHigh (from Steel Plate) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\nRahgot - OrkishLight (from Orkish) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\n\r\nKicked the stats for some of the other masks up to \"_High\" - nothing's more depressing than a crappy Dragon Priest mask. Specifically:\r\nKonahrik - DwarvenHigh (from Dwarven)\r\nHevnoraak - IronHigh (from Iron)\r\nVolsung - ScaledHigh (from Scaled) - it has a crappy enchantment, so it needs the armor rating boost.\r\nKrosis - ElvenHigh (from Elven)\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with 7 heavy and 6 light masks - Seems balanced.\r\n\r\nTL;DR I expanded and reworked Dragon Priest masks.","changed_files":1,"comments":0,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/issues/1/comments","commits":1,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/pulls/1/commits","created_at":"2015-01-01T15:01:06Z","deletions":16,"diff_url":"https://github.com/Raulfin/PCaPP/pull/1.diff","head":{"label":"Derathir:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","repo":{"archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/{archive_format}{/ref}","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/branches{/branch}","clone_url":"https://github.com/Derathir/PCaPP.git","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/contributors","created_at":"2015-01-01T14:16:43Z","default_branch":"master","description":"Repository
